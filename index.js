// Exercise 1

// Define a function logBetween(lowNum, highNum) that will print every number 
// from lowNum to highNum, inclusive. 
// Inclusive means that the range includes lowNum and highNum.

// Hint: this function only needs to print using console.log it does not need to return.



console.log('Exercise 1');

function logBetween(lowNum, highNum) {
    console.log("This is the ", lowNum);
    for (let i = lowNum; i <= highNum; i += 1) {
      console.log(i);
    }
  }

  function logBetweenWhile(lowNum, highNum) {
    let i = lowNum;
    while (i <= highNum) {
      console.log(i);
      i++;
    }
  }
//   data to be passed into the parameter as arguments when function is called
  // Examples:
  logBetween(-1, 2); // prints out:
  // -1
  // 0
  // 1
  // 2
  
  logBetween(14, 6); // => prints nothing
  
  logBetween(4, 6); // prints out:
  // 4
  // 5
  // 6



//   Exercise 2

//   Write a function printFives(max) that prints out the multiples of 5 
//   that are less than the max.

//   Try to solve this in two ways, one using an if statement, and one without.

// not working - assume the argument is set up incorrectly....

// create a function printFives with a parameter of max.

console.log('Exercise 2');

function printFives(max){
    console.log("This is my printFives function");
    // print out multiples of 5 that are less than max.
console.log("This is a multiple of five ", max % 5 === 0);
    let multiples = 
    let i = max; 
    if (max % 5 === 0){
          console.log("this is the max value ", max)
        console.log(i);
        i/5;
        console.log(i);
        
        console.log("this is ", (i))
    } else {
        console.log("conditions not met")
}
}
// Example:
// data to be passed into function when called

printFives(20) // prints out:
// 0
// 5
// 10
// 15







// Exercise 3

// Write a function logBetweenStepper(min, max, step) that takes in 3 numbers 
// as parameters. The function should print out numbers between min and max 
// at step intervals. See the following examples.

// Hint: this function only needs to print using console.log it does not need to return.

console.log('Exercise 3');



// Examples:
// un-comment the code below before running your code.
// logBetweenStepper(5, 9, 1); // prints out:
// 5
// 6
// 7
// 8
// 9

// un-comment the line below before running your code
// logBetweenStepper(-10, 15, 5)  

// prints out:
// -10
// -5
// 0
// 5
// 10
// 15









// Exercise 4

// Define a function fizzBuzz(max) that takes a number and prints every 
// number from 0 to max (not inclusive) that is divisible by either 3 or 5, 
// but not both.

console.log('Exercise 4');



// Examples:
// un-comment the line below before running your code

// fizzBuzz(20); 

// expeted returns listed below
// 3
// 5
// 6
// 9
// 10
// 12
// 18



// Exercise 5 (arrays)

// Write a function combineArray(array1, array2) that takes in two arrays 
// of numbers and returns the two arrays combined into a single array.

// Hint: Use the Array.concat method but be aware that calling 
// this method won't permanently change, also known as mutate, either array.

console.log('Exercise 5');



// un-comment the lines below before running your code
// console.log(combineArray([1, 2], [3, 4])); // Expected returns => [1, 2, 3, 4]
// console.log(combineArray([17, 5], [6, 7]));  //Expected returns => [17, 5, 6, 7]




// Exercise 6

// Write a function doubler(numbers) that takes an array of numbers 
// and returns a new array where every element of the original array 
// is multiplied by 2.

console.log('Exercise 6');

// starter code provided remove comment from function declaration to begin

// function doubler(numbers) {
 
}

// un-comment lies below before runing your code
// console.log(doubler([1, 2, 3, 4])); // => [2, 4, 6, 8]
// console.log(doubler([7, 1, 8])); // => [14, 2, 16]




// Exercise 7

// Write a function, countVowels(word), that takes in a string word and 
// returns the number of vowels in the word.
// Vowels are the letters "a", "e", "i", "o", "u".

console.log('Exercise 7');

un-comment starter code below to start

// function countVowels(word) {
    
//   };
  


// un-comment lines below before running your code

//   console.log(countVowels("bootcamp")); // expected return => 3
//   console.log(countVowels("apple")); //expected return  => 2
//   console.log(countVowels("pizza")); //expected return => 2


//   Exercise 8

// 1. Print all even numbers from 0 â€“ 10

cpmsp;else.log('Exercise 8');







// Exercise 9

// Print a table containing multiplication tables

// Let's start with the tables that many of us had to memorize in school.
//  Can you print a table that contains all the answers to the multiplication 
//  tables from 1 through 10?

console.log('Exercise 9');










// Exercise 10

// Create a length converter function

// Let's start with a conversion from kilometers to miles. 
// The function should include the input in kilometers and 
// return the answer in miles.

console.log('Exercise 10');







// Exercise 11

// Calculate the sum of numbers within an array

// You can create your own array of numbers but consider trying this problem 
// with a few different sets to verify your solution. 
// Have one array with negative and positive numbers and another with 
// integers and decimals.

// You could also try using arrays of different lengths. If you're feeling comfortable with this, 
// try the slightly more challenging bonus challenge below.

// Bonus intermediate challenge: Create a function that can return the 
// sum of a particular column or row number in a table.

console.log("Exercise 11");







// Exercise 12

// Create a function that reverses an array

// This challenge is particularly helpful if you're planning to become a 
// Data Scientist. Manipulating data is a significant part of the role, and 
// building the foundations now will help you later down the road when 
// you're working with large databases.

// Start small here and work your way up. Begin with an array of 5 numbers, 
// and then try your program with a larger array to verify its success.

console.log('Exercise 12');








// Exercise 13

// Sort an array from lowest to highest
// You could create a function for this solution as well, but be sure to 
// try your program with varying lengths and types of arrays. 
// Try one with all integers, another with negative numbers, and 
// another with decimals.

console.log('Exercise 13');






// Exercise 14

// Create a function that filters out negative numbers

// In this challenge, you'll have a function that takes an array as an input 
// and returns an array. But if all goes according to plan, it'll remove the 
// negative numbers. This is another example of a task that'll be useful 
// when combing through data and looking for clever ways to eliminate "bad data."

console.log("Exercise 14");






// Exercise 15
// Remove the spaces found in a string

// Yet another way to clean up data is to remove any errors or unnecessary spaces.
//  This function will take in a string and then return it with all spaces removed.
//  Think about if you were tasked with cleaning up customer data at your job.
//  You could scale this function to clean up specific fields of data, 
//  such as zip codes.

console.log("Exercise 15");


// Exercise 16

// Return a Boolean if a number is divisible by 10

// Here, you'll create a function that'll give you a "true" or "false" Boolean 
// as its output. The inputted number should only 
// return a "true" if it's divisible by 10. 
// Otherwise, your program should return a "false" answer.

console.log("Exercise 16");









// Exercise 17
// Return the number of vowels in a string

// Create a function that'll return an integer of the number of vowels found 
// in a string. This is a great way to practice determining the features of a 
// dataset. If you use JavaScript later in your career, you'll be well-prepared
//  to determine what datasets (or just strings) consist of. 
//  If you feel like an extra challenge, consider returning the number 
//  of characters.

console.log("Exercise 17");
